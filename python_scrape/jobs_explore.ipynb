    "- When you remove very old posts (30+ days) how much do these figures change?\n",

    "- What are the top 20 companies really pushing to hire?\n",
    "- What are the top 20 locations that are hiring? Does it matter?\n",

    "- **Where** -> what states are hiring the most people (with the understanding that a lot of work is remote, but this could change if restrictions begin to lift)\n",
